# Technical Test Project

Welcome to my technical test project. This repository consists of two main parts: the `API` (backend) and the `front-end`. These two projects work together to form a complete web application.

## Project Description

This technical test demonstrates a full-stack web application with a separate backend API and frontend interface. The backend connects to MongoDB Atlas for data persistence and interfaces with external services like Builder.io for content management. The frontend provides a user interface that interacts with the backend, presenting a seamless experience.

## Getting Started

To get the application running, you need to set up both the backend (API) and the frontend. The backend serves as the foundation, so it's recommended to start there.

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the `API` directory to find the backend portion of the project. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory to install dependencies, set up environment variables, and launch the project.

### Frontend Setup

Once the backend is up and running, move to the `front-end` directory. A separate `README.md` file is provided there with instructions for setting up the frontend, installing dependencies, and running the project.

### Important Notes

- Each directory (`API` and `front-end`) contains its own `package.json` file. Dependencies must be installed separately within each project directory.
- Environment variables need to be set up for the back-end as per the `.env.example` file in the API.
- It's crucial to start the backend server before the frontend as the latter depends on the API provided by the backend.

## Installation Order

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the backend:
    - Navigate to the `API` directory.
    - Install dependencies and set up the environment.
    - Start the backend server.
3. Set up the frontend:
    - Navigate to the `front-end` directory.
    - Install dependencies.
    - Launch the frontend application.
